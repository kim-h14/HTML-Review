My journey to learn to code has had ups and downs. This file as it is named is a HTML review where I went through the basics of HTML before heading back into more advance topics.

This has 2 small projects, and a few smaller files that broke down each basics into different elements.

The 2 small project compile all the basic elements of the HTML Boilerplates and the main elements needed to create an HTML page.
